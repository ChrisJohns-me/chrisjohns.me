## About Me

My name is Chris Johns, and I've been involved in front-end development for many years. I've got a decent eye for design and a huge curiosity for anything technology.

My top skills would include problem solving, user-interface design, and software development. With my graphic design background and user-interface familiarity, I have a unique perspective into how the user will interact with a particular design in software.

## #AnotherBlog

This blog wasn't created to force registrations on users and increase "engagement", it isn't meant for marketing myself, and it isn't intended to make money. I don't have any specific goals for this blog, except for sharing my random findings with whoever finds it. I'd also love discussions and receiving feedback about said findings, because I believe in the value of sharing knowledge. ❤️

The Johnny Decimal System is a way to organize your digital life. It's a system that I've been using for a while now and I've found it to be very effective. It's a simple system that is easy to understand and easy to use. It's a great way to keep your digital life organized and to make sure that you can find what you need when you need it.

For reference (and more in-depth information), you can visit the [Johnny Decimal website](https://johnnydecimal.com).

## My Summary

### Areas (group of categories) = Real-life Shelves

- Should be really, really broad. Might line up with areas of life.
- Only includes max of 10 categories.
- Formatted ex. “10-19 Life administration”

### Categories = Real-life Boxes

- Collection of similar things; a type of “work”.
- Prefer fewer, broader categories.
- Is named incrementally starting with 10.
- Formatted ex. “16 Travel”

### Directories = Real-life Manilla Folders

- Uses IDs as the start of the naming..
- Is named incrementally starting with 01.
- Formatted ex. “16.01 Singapore, June 2022”
- Avoid sub-folders below this point if you can.
- ID - A unique thing; a job, a task, a reference, a meeting, an artifact.

### Files/Documents = Real-life Papers

- These are the actual files/documents.
- Saved within Directories with IDs.
- Never save these within areas, or categories.
- Nothing is saved more than 2 levels deep (not past Directories); in-fact, EVERYTHING is EXACTLY 2 levels deep.

### Example
